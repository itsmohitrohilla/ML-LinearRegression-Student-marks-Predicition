# ML-LinearRegression-Student-marks-Predicition
This is a Machine linear model of Linear Regression, Where I train model with student study hours and predict the marks on the basis of study hours. 
I have used tkinter package to deploy my ml model and my model gives 95% accuracy. All juypter and py files are attacted, and here is the screenshot of the output.
